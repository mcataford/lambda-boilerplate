## Overview

AWS Lambdas are fun, but often the amount of boilerplate involved in getting a project off the ground hinders the fun. From setting up a local environment to writing out a Cloudformation template, the overhead of Lambda-based greenfield projects can be daunting. No more. Just use this repository as a template or clone it and jump straight into the action! This repository offers a quick template your can use, full with a Docker setup for local development and invocation commands that you can use to package and deploy small Lambdas.

Use this as a foundation and tweak it to your use case!

## Local development

To get started, hit the bootstrap script with `. script/bootstrap`. This will set up a Python 3.8 virtualenv set up with some basic tools that will make your life easier.

The base Lambda handler is at `src/base.py` and all the infrastructure templates and Sceptre configuration are in `infrastructure`.

### Invocations

This template uses PyInvoke, all commands are of the format `inv <command> <parameters>`.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`app.start`|Start your Lambda in Docker.|
|`app.stop`|Stop and remove the container.|
|`app.invoke-function <function name> <Serialized JSON payload>`|Invokes the given local Lambda by container name|
|`stack.deploy`|Packages your code and deploys the stack|
|`stack.teardown-app`|Tears down the application stack|
|`stack.teardown-bootstrap`|Tears down the bootstrap stack| 

## Deployment

The base setup assumes that your Lambda handler is located in `src.base`. Doing `inv stack.deploy` will zip up your `src` directory, create an S3 bucket for your development artifacts, uploads the source doe archive to S3 and kickstarts the Cloudformation deployment of your stack.

Feature requests should keep in mind that the goal of this boilerplate is to be general enough so that the cost of tailoring it to specific use cases is low.
